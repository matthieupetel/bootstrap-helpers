=================

This repository aims to provide tools and tips for faster front-end [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) 
based projects initializations.

Check out the branch corresponding to the Bootstrap version you are using:

## Examples:

**Overridden variables**  
When using Boostrap for building a website, the default styles / colors / dimensions often don't match your needs.  
The Bootstrap variables values must be changed, and the provided `overridden-variables` files allow that easily. 
Just import the file in the main stylesheet and start customizing Bootstrap default values. 

**Showcase**  
When designing a new project, it is easy to modify Bootstrap componenets and alter their layout.
The `showcase` allow to have in one place all the main Bootstrap components (buttons, typography, tables, 
dropdowns, etc.) at sight to be sure that everything works and looks well.
